# Google Calendar Electron

This is an electron app wrapping
[https://calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com). It provides
nothing on top of Google Calendar other than putting it in an independent
window.

# Building and Running

To build the app use the Makefile.

```sh
make
```

If you're lucky, you'll then have the file `target/google-calendar-darwin-x64/google-calendar.app`.
